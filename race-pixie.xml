			<p class="flavor">They are a clever people with love for tricks, glee, and food. Haling from the Ever Gleam, these curious creatures are magical by nature. Each "born" connected to a season or tasked with defending the natural world. Fairies are broken into two kinds, Pixies and Sprites. In the Ever Gleam Pixies tend to the natural world's cycle's, actively. Pixies are fairies tied to the seasons. While sprites are connected defending the natural world and work against unnatural threats. While most lump them into one group of playful tricksters this is not the case. All pixies love to play tricks, be merry, and enjoy living; but the severity changes with each season. The season of the pixie is based on the season of the year. Spring fairies tend to be the most innocent and playful. Summer fairies have the most energy and tend to enjoy tricks. Autumn Fairies tend to be fickle and their tricks can leave someone as a "fool". Winter fairies are the most reserved and tend to only play tricks as lessons, and those lessons can on occasion leave someone hurt. Sprites are tied to the landscape. Taking on characteristics of the land they inhabit. While humanoid they are not "little-people". They do eat, but its a diet of plants, flowers, and spices that other races would call inedible or poisonous.</p>
			<h4>SLENDER AND GRACEFUL</h4>
			<p>They tend to stand about 9 inches through 1'3" tall and weigh about as much as a kitten.</p>
			<p class="indent">Colors tend to hold to their season, but the colors vary wildly. (Though any color is possible.) Their skin stands between fair, tan, dark, or even strange colors. Many fairies love to dress simply, but simple does not mean boring. Their wings can be any color and the shapes tend to range from butterfly wings to moth wings.</p>
			<h4>FAERIE NAMES</h4>
			<p>Faerie are considered children until they reach some form of maturity unrecognizable by non-Fey.</p>
			<p class="indent">On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.</p>
